Navigate the maze and find the princess within
Beware the enemies who believes you have sinned
When touched by enemy, a Shakespearian line will appear
Type the next line in the textbox before it disapear
or else you'll go back to beginning under hateful glares
Too dangerous to go along, it is
Find the old man in the maze
And recieve the map that'll guide you out of this place 
Go, legendary hero, the princess awaits
This is no English project for Computer Science is the way
